Design and planning notes from my notebook:

#### Basic features ####

At a bare minimum the following features should be supported:

* View all podcasts

List all podcasts in the application. Each podcast is selectable and
menu options allow access to download new shows for all podcasts and
add podcast.

* View podcast

View a podcast and all shows for the podcast. Select a podcast to view
it and menu option for download new shows for the podcast and delete
podcast.

* View show

View a show. Allow download of the show (if not already downloaded) and
play show for downloaded shows.

* Play show

Allow play/pause of show.

* Add podcast

Add a podcast. Shows already existing in the feed are not downloaded and
not "new" shows. Users have to download them manually.

* Delete podcast

Delete the podcast, all shows and downloaded items.

* Download new shows for all podcasts
* Download new shows for podcast
* Download show

Figure it out.
